# MA615-HW-2
This is my HW#2 on MA615(FALL 2021).
Gapminder has a wealth of country-level statistics. Therefore, this HW is about exploring that data, and then presenting what I have noticed.
Additionally, I am going to explain how I went about the coding of my presentation.

- Wrangling
- Visualizing 

This is my first time to try to download the datasets from the website and do the visualization. Although I have not master how to clean the original dataset, I still try my best to deletes missing values in the data frame. Moreover, this is also my first time to use ggplot by using points, lines and bars to show the relationship between the indicators. The most interesting thing is drawing the maps at the end of porject.

Thank you!:)
